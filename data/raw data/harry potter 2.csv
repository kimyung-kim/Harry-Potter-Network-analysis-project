Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Photographer,Ginny Weasley,"Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,It can't be- Harry Potter?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Photographer,Harry Potter,"Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,・ which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving・ with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter・ Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name・or very foolish."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Hermione Granger,Lucius Malfoy,Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,Hermione Granger,"And you must be・ Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see・red hair・ vacant expressions・ tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,Arthur Weasley,"Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Arthur Weasley,Lucius Malfoy,Lucius.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,Arthur Weasley,"Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Arthur Weasley,Lucius Malfoy,"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Lucius Malfoy,Arthur Weasley,Clearly. Associating with Muggles・ and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flourish and Blotts,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,See you at school.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Flying to Hogwarts,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Marcus Flint,Ron Weasley,A gift from Draco's father.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Hermione Granger,Draco Malfoy,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Draco Malfoy,Hermione Granger,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,He called me a Mudblood.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,He did not!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What's a Mudblood?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,It means ＾dirty blood.￣ Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call ＾pure blood.￣"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,That's horrible!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,It's disgusting.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"And it's codswallop, to boot. ＾Dirty blood.￣ Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here・ Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute・ eh?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Harry, Harry, Harry・ Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,Not really.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,Voice?

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Mudbloods and murmurs,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,Spooky.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",That voice.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Voice? What voice?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Basilisk,Harry Potter,It's time.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Kill?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I don't like spiders・ What's that?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",The Chamber of Secrets has been opened・ enemies the heir・ beware.' It's written in blood.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Oh, no・ It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Students,,Ahhh! What's that?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Poppy Pomfrey,,Oh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Draco Malfoy,All,"Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!"

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,Argus Filch,No. No.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,"Argus! Argus, I・ Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except・ you three."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Other,,"Ravenclaws, follow me!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,"She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Gilderoy Lockhart,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Argus Filch,Albus Dumbledore,Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Argus Filch,Harry Potter,Rubbish!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,"If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Gilderoy Lockhart,Severus Snape,"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Severus Snape,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Severus Snape,Hermione Granger,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Argus Filch,Albus Dumbledore,My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution・ to all."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Strange?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just・ strange."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Are you mad?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Kill!,Man in a painting,Harry Potter,"She's right, you know."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Minerva McGonagall,All,"Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. ＾One, two, three. Vera verto.￣"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Ron Weasley,,Ahem. Vera verto!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Students,,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Minerva McGonagall,Ron Weasley,"That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,Minerva McGonagall,"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about・the Chamber of Secrets?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Minerva McGonagall,All,"Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Three guesses who.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Minerva McGonagall,All,"Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, ＾pure-bloods.￣ Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,Minerva McGonagall,Muggle-borns.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Minerva McGonagall,All,"Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,Minerva McGonagall,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Minerva McGonagall,All,"Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,If you're talking about Malfoy.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,About the Chamber,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well, how long will it take to make?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,A month.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I know. But it's the only plan we've got.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Students,,Yeah! Come on Slytherin!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Lee Jordan,,Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Marcus Flint,,Yeah! Yeah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"All right there, Scarhead?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Oliver Wood,Harry Potter,"Watch yourself, Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Harry Potter,Oliver Wood,Wood! Look out!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,I'll stop it.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"You'll never catch me, Potter!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Let's go.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Lee Jordan,,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Rogue Bludger,Hermione Granger,,Finite incantatem!

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Are you okay?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"No, I think my- I think my arm's broken."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,"No, not you."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this・ won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Students,,Oh! Ooh! Ugh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Other,,Ohh! Uhh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"・you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Rubeus Hagrid,Gilderoy Lockhart,Broken? There's no bones left!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Students,,Uh-huh-ugh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Much more flexible, though."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Draco Malfoy,Poppy Pomfrey,"Uhh, uhhh・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Poppy Pomfrey,Harry Potter,"Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Hermione Granger,Poppy Pomfrey,"You will be able to, won't you?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Poppy Pomfrey,Harry Potter,"Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Poppy Pomfrey,Ugh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Poppy Pomfrey,Harry Potter,"Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,,Uh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Basilisk,Harry Potter,Kill. Kill・ Time to kill!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,Hello!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,Dobby?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,It was you・ You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,"Indeed. Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,"Uhuh・ Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,Uh-huh-huh・ Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,"Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin・uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,"This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,,Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,"Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Dobby,Harry Potter,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Harry Potter,Dobby,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Poppy Pomfrey,Albus Dumbledore,Put him here. What happened?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Albus Dumbledore,Poppy Pomfrey,There's been another attack.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Minerva McGonagall,Poppy Pomfrey,"I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Minerva McGonagall,Albus Dumbledore,"What can this mean, Albus?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Albus Dumbledore,Minerva McGonagall,It means・that our students are in great danger.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Minerva McGonagall,Albus Dumbledore,What should I tell the staff.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,No longer safe,Albus Dumbledore,Minerva McGonagall,"The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Heh・ No. No one ever comes in here.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Why?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Moaning Myrtle.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Who?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Moaning Myrtle.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Moaning Myrtle,Ron Weasley,"I'm Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn't expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh・aaaah!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,She's a little sensitive.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,All,"Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Severus Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,,Whoaah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Do you think he's all right?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Who cares?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,Severus Snape,"An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Severus Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah・ Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,"Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Good luck, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Thank you, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy",Wands at the ready.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Scared, Potter?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,You wish.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy","On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two--"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,Everte statium!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Hermione Granger,,Oh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Vincent Crabbe,,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dueling Club,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,Rictusempra!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy",I said disarm only!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,Serpensortia!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Gilderoy Lockhart,Severus Snape,"Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,,Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Vipera evenesca.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Justin Finch-Fletchley,Harry Potter,What are you playing at?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I'm a what?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,You can talk to snakes.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Oh, that's what you said to it!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You were there! You heard me!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",But I'm not・ I can't be.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Students,,
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,A Parselmouth,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",I'll see you back in the common room.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Argus Filch,No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Minerva McGonagall,,Oh!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,Professor・ I swear I didn't!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Professor Dumbledore?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Sorting Hat,Harry Potter,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Sorting Hat,I・ I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Sorting Hat,Harry Potter,"Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Sorting Hat,You're wrong.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Sorting Hat,Harry Potter,Umm・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Harry?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,"Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,"In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, of course you don't, and・ Oh・ Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You don't think it was me, Professor?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you・ But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"No, sir. Nothing."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Nothing to tell,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Very well, then. Off you go."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Crabbe and Goyle.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,How?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode? Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Ahem・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Yeah. Right.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Vincent Crabbe,Gregory Goyle,It's good right? Ah・ Cool!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Vincent Crabbe,Gregory Goyle,Ummm・um.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Gregory Goyle,Vincent Crabbe,Ummm・um.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,How thick could you get?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Come on. Let's get 'em.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves・ Add the hairs.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Ugh- essence of Crabbe.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Bloody hell!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Polyjuice Potion,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry and Ron transformed.,Draco Malfoy,"Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle","Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry and Ron transformed.,Draco Malfoy,"Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle","You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry and Ron transformed.,Draco Malfoy,"Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle",What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well? Do you?,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well? Do you?,Draco Malfoy,Gregory Goyle,"You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very・odd."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well? Do you?,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,It's his・ stomachache. Calm down.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Is there something you wish to tell me?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"No, sir. Nothing."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"Very well, then. Off you go."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"Good night, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Rubeus Hagrid,,Let's get yeh out of there.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Rubeus Hagrid,"Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Rubeus Hagrid,Tom Riddle,You can't! You don't understand.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Rubeus Hagrid,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Rubeus Hagrid,Tom Riddle,It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Rubeus Hagrid,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Rubeus Hagrid,Tom Riddle,No!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Rubeus Hagrid,"Stand aside, Hagrid!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Rubeus Hagrid,Tom Riddle,No!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,,Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Rubeus Hagrid,,Aragog! Aragog!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Tom Riddle,Rubeus Hagrid,"I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid! Haagriid!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Hello, can you hear me?",Harry Potter,,Woah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"That'll be a cheerful visit! ＾Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?￣"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Rubeus Hagrid,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger","Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Rubeus Hagrid,Neville Longbottom,"Hello, Neville!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Oliver Wood,All,"Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Fred Weasley,Oliver Wood,"And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Oliver Wood,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, that too. Professor McGonagall."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Minerva McGonagall,Oliver Wood,This match has been cancelled.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Oliver Wood,Minerva McGonagall,We can't cancel Quidditch.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Minerva McGonagall,Oliver Wood,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Minerva McGonagall,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Hermione!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Minerva McGonagall,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,No.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Minerva McGonagall,All,"Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. ＾All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.￣ I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Petrified,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Who's there? Hello? Hello?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,What's that for?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah・ It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,I'm fine! I'm alright.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Did you hear about Hermione?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"What you had to understand about that is?  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you・ Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,"Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we・?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,Of course! Come in! Come in.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Cornelius Fudge,Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,Cornelius Fudge,"Already here, Fudge? Good・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Lucius Malfoy,What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,Rubeus Hagrid,"Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,"The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Lucius Malfoy,"Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,Rubeus Hagrid,You think so?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,"Albus Dumbledore, Cornelius Fudge",Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"Come, Hagrid・ Well?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Cornelius Fudge,,Good boy.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What?!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be ＾follow the butterflies?￣
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, I don't like this・ Harry, I don't like this at all!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Shush!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Can we go back now?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Come on!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,Who is it?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Don't panic.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,Hagrid? Is that you?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Aragog,We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Aragog,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Aragog,Then you're not the monster.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,"No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Aragog,"Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Aragog,But have you seen it?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Aragog,Harry Potter,"I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Aragog,Ron Weasley,,Ahh- hhh・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Aragog,"Well, thank you. We'll just・go."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Aragog,Harry Potter,"Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Can we panic now?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Know any spells?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Where's Hermione when you need her?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Whoah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Whoah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Arania exumai!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Thanks for that.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Aah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Aah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,The flying gear's jammed!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Come on! Pull!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I'm trying!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Spider attack,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Wish you were here Hermione. We need you・ now, more than ever."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What's that?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin・Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione・had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Hermione's answered that, too."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Moaning Myrtle.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Minerva McGonagall,All,"All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Minerva McGonagall,All,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Gilderoy Lockhart,Minerva McGonagall,So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Severus Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Gilderoy Lockhart,Severus Snape,My m-moment?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Severus Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Minerva McGonagall,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Gilderoy Lockhart,Minerva McGonagall,"Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Poppy Pomfrey,Minerva McGonagall,"Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Minerva McGonagall,Poppy Pomfrey,Ginny Weasley.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Missing,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,What about my sister?!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron Weasley,"Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron Weasley,Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,Books can be misleading!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,You wrote them!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,Is there anything you can do?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron Weasley,"Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah・I'm ah・going to have to do the same to you."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,Don't even think about it.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Moaning Myrtle,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Oh! Who's there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Moaning Myrtle,To ask you how you died.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Moaning Myrtle,Harry Potter,"Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Moaning Myrtle,Who was it Myrtle?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Moaning Myrtle,Harry Potter,"I don't know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh・But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and・ I died."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Moaning Myrtle,Just like that? How?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Moaning Myrtle,Harry Potter,"I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes・over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo・"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,,Hesha- Hassah.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah・ There's no need for me to stay."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Oh, yes there is! You first."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,"Now, boys what good will it do?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,Better you than us.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron Weasley,"Um・but・obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy down here."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,All right. Let's go.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Moaning Myrtle,Harry Potter,"Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Moaning Myrtle,Uh・thanks Myrtle.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,,Aaah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,,Aaah!

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Chamber of Secrets,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Go on.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Gilderoy Lockhart",This way.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Gilderoy Lockhart",What's this?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",It looks like a・ snake.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Gilderoy Lockhart",It's a snakeskin.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Backfire,Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron Weasley,"It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?"

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,She won't wake.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not・?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"She's still alive, but only just."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,Are you a ghost?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,It won't come until it's called.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"Give me my wand, Tom."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,You won't be needing it.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,But why?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"But, why did you want to meet me?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target・ has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Voldemort is my past, present, and future."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Harry Potter,Tom Riddle,He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Heir of Slytherin,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- S?lithaeine."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Tom Riddle,,"No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very・ much・ alive!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,The Basilisk,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Ginny-
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Tom Riddle,Harry Potter,"Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do・ especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Ginny・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and・ Harry, you're hurt!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough・ Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Healing powers,Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry Potter,Amazing! This is just like magic!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Ron Weasley,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Ron Weasley,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Ron Weasley,Albus Dumbledore,"Thanks, sir!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry・ first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um・ second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It's just・ You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort transferred some of his powers・ to me?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Not intentionally, but yes."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Because I asked it to.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Godric Gryffindor.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Out of the hat,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Dobby,Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Harry Potter,Um-humm・
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,Ridiculous!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,How dare you?!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,I beg your pardon?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,"My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Oh, yes."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,And? Who was it?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,Voldemort.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,Ah!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,I see.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Albus Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Don't worry. I will be.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,"Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,,Ahh! Oow!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,"Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,"Harry Potter, Dobby","You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Dobby,Open it.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,Dobby?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Lucius Malfoy,Master has given Dobby a sock!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,What? I didn't give.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Lucius Malfoy,Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,You've lost me my servant!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Lucius Malfoy,You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,Advada.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Harry Potter,Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Dobby,Just promise me something.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Dobby,Harry Potter,"Anything, sir!"
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Dobby's reward,Harry Potter,Dobby,Never try to save my life again.
