Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,"Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,What is it?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,Nothing. School stuff.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,"Later perhaps, if you behave."

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,"Harry Potter, Dudley Dursley","Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,Take Marge's suitcase upstairs!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,Okay.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,Ripper,"Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Marge Dursley,"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,"Marge Dursley, Petunia Dursley, Ripper, Harry Potter","Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm! You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Marge Dursley,St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,Harry Potter,"Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Marge Dursley,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,"Marge Dursley, Petunia Dursley, Harry Potter, Vernon Dursley, Dudley Dursley","Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Petunia Dursley,Marge Dursley,Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,Petunia Dursley,"And a drunk too, no doubt?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Marge Dursley,That's a lie!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,Harry Potter,What did you say?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Marge Dursley,My dad wasn't a drunk!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,Petunia Dursley,"Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,I think it's time you went to bed.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,"Marge Dursley, Petunia Dursley, Harry Potter, Vernon Dursley, Dudley Dursley","Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Marge Dursley,Shut up! Shut up!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Marge Dursley,"Harry Potter, Vernon Dursley","Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!"

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,Yeah? Try me.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Aunt Marge's Big Mistake,Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,"Welcome to the Knight Bus... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. What you doing down there?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,I fell over.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,What you fall over for?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,I didn't do it on purpose.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,"Well, come on, then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. What you looking at?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,Nothing.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Ernie Prang,"Take her away, Ern."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Shrunken head,Ernie Prang,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's going to be a bumpy ride."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,What did you say your name was again?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,I didn't.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,Whereabouts are you headed?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Ernie Prang,You heard that Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Shrunken head,Harry Potter,The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... make sure you eat it before it eats you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,"Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Shrunken head,"Stanley Shunpike, Ernie Prang","No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, three and a half... two, one and three quarters. Yes!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,Who is that? That man.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,"Who is that? Who is...? That is Sirius Black, that is. Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. He's a murderer. Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,How did he escape?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Stanley Shunpike,Harry Potter,"Well, that's the question, isn't it? He's the first one that done it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-Who. I reckon you've heard of him."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Harry Potter,Stanley Shunpike,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Knight Bus,Shrunken head,"Ernie Prang, Stanley Shunpike, Harry Potter","Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. The Leaky Cauldron. Next stop, Knockturn Alley."

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,Hedwig,Hedwig.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Tom,Harry Potter,"Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... and no harm done."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Tom,Harry Potter,Pea soup?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,"Tom, Cornelius Fudge","No, thank you. Minister?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Yes?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,I don't understand.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Understand?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Come now, Harry the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,"The state of things, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,We have a killer on the loose.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,"Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Harry Potter,Hedwig,Hedwig.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Leaky Cauldron,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Maid,,Housekeeping. I'll come back later.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Egypt. What's it like?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Along with the dung beetle.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Fred Weasley,Ron Weasley,Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,George Weasley,Ron Weasley,Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Ron Weasley,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",I haven't shown anyone.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Fred Weasley,Ron Weasley,"No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,George Weasley,Ron Weasley,"No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,Mrs. Weasley.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,"Good to see you, dear."

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,Yes? All of your books?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,"Yeah, it's all upstairs."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,All of your clothes?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,Everything's there.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,Good boy.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,Thank you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry Potter.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Mr. Weasley.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, wonder if I might have a word?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,"Yeah, sure."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Hermione Granger,Hermione.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Hermione Granger,Arthur Weasley,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,Looking forward to a new term?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Yeah. It should be great.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Voldemort.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,Don't say his name.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Sorry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"When you stopped You-Know-Who... Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,And kill me.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,In Grave Danger,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Molly Weasley,Ron Weasley,"Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I still think it was brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Come on. Everywhere else is full.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Who do you think that is?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Professor R.J. Lupin.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Oh.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Do you think he's really asleep?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Seems to be. Why?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",I gotta tell you something.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Yeah.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Thanks, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",What's going on?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Bloody hell! What's happening?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry. Harry, are you all right?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Thank you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,What was that thing that came?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",What happened to me?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",But someone was screaming. A woman.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"No one was screaming, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Ron Weasley,Draco Malfoy,"Shove off, Malfoy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",How did he find out?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Just forget it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Seamus Finnigan,The Fat Lady,"Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in. Fortuna Major."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,The Fat Lady,Seamus Finnigan,"No, no, no. Wait, wait. Watch this. Oh, amazing! Just with my voice."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Harry Potter,The Fat Lady,Fortuna Major.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,The Fat Lady,Harry Potter,"Yes, all right. Go in."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Harry Potter,The Fat Lady,Thank you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Ron Weasley,"Seamus Finnigan, Neville Longbottom","Green. That's a monkey. What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Seamus Finnigan,Ron Weasley,"Ron, catch."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Ron Weasley,Seamus Finnigan,I will.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Seamus Finnigan,"Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",I think we have a winner.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Welcome and Warning,Ron Weasley,"Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan, Harry Potter","Oh, don't try one of them. Oh, no. Look at him. His face."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Sybill Trelawney,All,"Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look beyond."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",What a load of rubbish.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Where did you come from?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Me? I've been here all this time.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Sybill Trelawney,Neville Longbottom,"You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Neville Longbottom,Sybill Trelawney,I think so.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Sybill Trelawney,"Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley","I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,Sybill Trelawney,Sure.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Sybill Trelawney,Ron Weasley,Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,Sybill Trelawney,"Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,"Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... you have the Grim."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Other,,"The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... of death."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,A fair few.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Tea Leaves,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,All,"That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Rubeus Hagrid,Exactly how do we do that?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Draco Malfoy,"Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Neville Longbottom,"Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Neville Longbottom,Draco Malfoy,I'm okay. Okay.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",I think they're funny.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,"Shut up, Malfoy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,All,D-Dementor! Dementor!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Just ignore him.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Ron Weasley,Neville Longbottom,You're supposed to stroke it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Neville Longbottom,Ron Weasley,Yeah.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,All,Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,All,"That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,What?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"That was wicked, Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Oh, please."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Well done, well done. How am I doing me first day?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Brilliant, professor."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Buckbeak,"Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Draco Malfoy,"Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Rubeus Hagrid,It's killed me! It's killed me!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Draco Malfoy,Calm down! It's just a scratch!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Buckbeak,Oh You're gonna regret this.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Rubeus Hagrid,All,Class dismissed!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Buckbeak,Draco Malfoy,Buckbeak,You and your bloody chicken!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Pansy Parkinson,Draco Malfoy,"Does it hurt terribly, Draco?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Draco Malfoy,Pansy Parkinson,"It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. I couldn't do homework for weeks."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger","Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Seamus Finnigan,All,He's been sighted! He's been sighted!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Ron Weasley,Seamus Finnigan,Who?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Seamus Finnigan,Ron Weasley,Sirius Black!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Hermione Granger,All,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Other,All,"You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? With dementors at every entrance?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Seamus Finnigan,All,Dementors? He's already slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Other,All,That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,All,"Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Dean Thomas,Remus Lupin,"That's a boggart, that is."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,"Dean Thomas, All","Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Hermione Granger,Remus Lupin,No one knows.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,When did she get here?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Hermione Granger,Remus Lupin,Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,"Hermione Granger, All","So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,All,,Riddikulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,All,Very good. A little louder and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,All,,Riddikulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Draco Malfoy,,This class is ridiculous.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,All,"Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Uh... Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Neville Longbottom,Remus Lupin,Professor Snape.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,Neville Longbottom,Sorry?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Neville Longbottom,Remus Lupin,Professor Snape.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,Neville Longbottom,"Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. And I believe you live with your grandmother."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Neville Longbottom,Remus Lupin,"Y-Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,Neville Longbottom,"No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Neville Longbottom,Remus Lupin,She carries a red handbag...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,Neville Longbottom,"We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Neville Longbottom,,Riddikulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,"Neville Longbottom, All","Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line! Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron, wand at the ready."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Ron Weasley,,Riddikulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,"Ron Weasley, Parvati Patil","Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Parvati Patil,,Riddikulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Boggart in the Wardrobe,Remus Lupin,All,"And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Minerva McGonagall,"All, Harry Potter","Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Argus Filch,All,"Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger","Forget about it, guys. See you later."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Talent for Trouble,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's going on?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Probably Neville forgotten the password again.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Neville Longbottom,Ron Weasley,Hey!.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Ron Weasley,Neville Longbottom,"Oh, you're there."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Percy Weasley,All,"Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Ginny Weasley,,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Ron Weasley,All,Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"It's not funny, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Percy Weasley,All,"Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,All,Make way.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Percy Weasley,All,The headmaster's here.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Come on, move."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Percy Weasley,All,You heard. Move!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Argus Filch,Albus Dumbledore,"There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Percy Weasley,All,Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! Come back here!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,All,Keep moving!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,The Fat Lady,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,The Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,"Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Argus Filch,Albus Dumbledore,"I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir. But there's nothing there."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Argus Filch,"Ah, thank you."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Filius Flitwick,Albus Dumbledore,"The third floor's clear too, sir."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Filius Flitwick,Very good.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,"I've done the dungeons, headmaster. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,I didn't really expect him to linger.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,"Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Quite remarkable, yes."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Any theories on how he managed it?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,What about Potter? Should he be warned?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Flight of the Fat Lady,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,All,Turn to page 394.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Ron Weasley,,Werewolves?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Hermione Granger,Severus Snape,"But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,Hermione Granger,Quiet.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,When did she come in? Did you see her come in?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,All,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? How disappointing."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Hermione Granger,Severus Snape,"Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"He's got a point, you know."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,All,"Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Substitute Teacher,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Albus Dumbledore,All,Arresto momentum!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Ron Weasley,Fred Weasley,"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Fred Weasley,Ron Weasley,Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,George Weasley,Ron Weasley,"Yeah, come on Ron, let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,George Weasley,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,How are you feeling?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Oh, brilliant."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"You gave us a right good scare there, mate."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Fred Weasley,What happened?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Well, you fell off your broom."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"I'm scared, professor."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Well I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,There was only one that night.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,But you made it go away.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Grim Defeat,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Argus Filch,All,"Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Fred Weasley, George Weasley","Guys, let me go."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Clever, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"But not clever enough. Besides, we've got a better way."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Fred Weasley, George Weasley",I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Oh. Bless him.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Fred Weasley, George Weasley","Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Now, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Come and join the big boys.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,Come and join the big boys.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Fred Weasley, George Weasley",What are you doing?!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Fred Weasley, George Weasley",What's this rubbish?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,What's this rubbish? he says. That there it's the secret to our success.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,It's a wrench giving it to you believe me. But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"George, if you will."

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,In his study.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Pacing.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,Does that a lot.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Harry Potter,"Fred Weasley, George Weasley",So you mean this map shows...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Everyone.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Knicked it from Filch's office, of course. First year."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Now listen, there are seven secret passageways... out of the castle. We'd recommend"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,This one.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,This one.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's seller.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,You best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Marauder's Map,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Other,,"Now, how much do you want? Delicious."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Twice.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Do you want to move a bit closer?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,To the Shrieking Shack?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Actually, I'm fine here."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Draco Malfoy,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger","Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in uh... one room?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Ron Weasley,Draco Malfoy,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Draco Malfoy,Ron Weasley,"Uh, Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Hermione Granger,Draco Malfoy,Hope you don't mean yourself!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Draco Malfoy,Hermione Granger,How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? Don't stand there! Do something!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Vincent Crabbe,Draco Malfoy,What?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Ron Weasley,Draco Malfoy,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Draco Malfoy,Vincent Crabbe,Get out of the way! Move!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Vincent Crabbe,Draco Malfoy,Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Who's There?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",That's not true!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Minerva McGonagall,Professor McGonagall!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Cornelius Fudge,Cornelius!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rubeus Hagrid,Cornelius Fudge,"Allow me, minister."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, Hagrid..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rubeus Hagrid,Cornelius Fudge,Sorry about that.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,"Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Cornelius Fudge,It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,We have... We have a killer on the loose!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Cornelius Fudge,Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,Harry Potter.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,Come.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Shrunken head,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",No underage wizards allowed in today! Shut the damn door!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,So rude.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Thick heads.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Shrunken head,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Thick heads?! How dare they! Who are they calling thick heads? Young whippersnappers!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Minerva McGonagall,Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits. Why?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,"Professor Dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, I can assure you."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Minerva McGonagall,"Now, tell me what this is all about."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,"Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,"Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Cornelius Fudge,Peter Pettigrew?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,"Yes, little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Minerva McGonagall,"Ah, I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,"Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,"Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,And now he wants to finish what he started.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,Mhmm.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,"Minerva McGonagall, Cornelius Fudge",I don't believe it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,"Ah, that's not the worst of it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Rosmerta,Cornelius Fudge,What could be worse?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I Hope He Finds Me,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I'm sure.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Well, everything's prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Expecto Patronum.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,That's one nasty dementor.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,The first time I rode a broom.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"There's another. It's not... happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I think I've had enough for today.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Beautiful day.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Gorgeous.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Ronald has lost his rat.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Rubbish.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Your cat killed him!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Did not.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Did.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Didn't.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,"Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,And then?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,They're not sacking you!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Patronus,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. I don't wanna tap-dance!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You tell those spiders Ron.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Rosmerta,Minerva McGonagall,Peter Pettigrew?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Minerva McGonagall,Rosmerta,Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Cornelius Fudge,Rosmerta,"Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ghost,Harry Potter,Put that light out!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Ghost,Sorry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ghost,Harry Potter,"Watch it there, boy."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ghost,Harry Potter,We're trying to sleep here!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ghost,Harry Potter,"Yes, we are."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,,Mischief managed. Nox.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,I was sleepwalking.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Spare bit of parchment.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Go on.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Why, you insolent little..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Severus Snape,Professor!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Remus Lupin,"Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry, are you alright?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Severus Snape,Remus Lupin,"That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Severus Snape,"Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Ghost,Severus Snape,Are you deaf? Put that light out!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"No. No, sir."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Oh, really? And who might that be?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Peter Pettigrew.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,That's not possible.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Seeing the Impossible,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"It's just what I saw. Good night, professor."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Sybill Trelawney,All,"Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Hermione Granger,Sybill Trelawney,"Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Sybill Trelawney,Hermione Granger,"My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Hang on. We better take this back.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I'm not going back.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Fine. See you later.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,See you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Harry Potter...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Harry Potter,Sybill Trelawney,Professor Trelawney...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,He will return tonight.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Harry Potter,Sybill Trelawney,Sorry?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,"Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Professor Trelawney's Prediction,Harry Potter,Sybill Trelawney,No. Nothing.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,It just got worse.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Draco Malfoy,Vincent Crabbe,Now I'll tell you. Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. Look who's here. Come to see the show?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,Draco Malfoy,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Vincent Crabbe,Draco Malfoy,"Malfoy, are you okay? Let's go. Quick."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Draco Malfoy,Hermione Granger,"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",That felt good.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Not good, brilliant!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Why don't we just set him free?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble. He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,Scabbers,Scabbers! You're alive!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I think that means you owe someone an apology.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I meant me!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Blimey! What was that?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Ow! Hagrid!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Oh, crikey."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Very interesting.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"No, minister. Over this way."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Go on, go on!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, that's the... lings you see over there..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,On the slope.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,Professor Dumbledore.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Good evening.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Cornelius Fudge,"Minister. Just make your way through. Have a tea, if you like."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"No, Hagrid, thank you. Now gentlemen..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,I'd like to have a cup of tea.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Cornelius Fudge,"Dear, dear..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Albus Dumbledore,Rubeus Hagrid,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,The execution shall dispatch...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",What?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Let's go!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Rubeus Hagrid,Cornelius Fudge,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Witnesses to an Execution,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger","Oh, no."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",He bit me! Scabbers!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Ron. Ron! Ron!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Ron Weasley,Scabbers,"Scabbers, come back!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Wait!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Ron Weasley,Scabbers,"Scabbers, you bit me!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger","Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Help!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Duck!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Don't worry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Where do you suppose this goes?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Womping Willow,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Come on. Ron.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Harry it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,Sirius Black,"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,No. Only one will die tonight.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Then it'll be you!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Sirius Black,"Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,"Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you Remus? I found him."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Sirius Black,I know.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,It's him.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Sirius Black,I understand.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Let's kill him!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,Sirius Black,"No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Hermione Granger,How long have you known?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,Remus Lupin,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Hermione Granger,"Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age, I've ever met."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,"Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Sirius Black,Wait!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Sirius Black,Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're dead!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"Who was it, then?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Severus Snape,Remus Lupin,Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Severus Snape,Severus...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Severus Snape,Remus Lupin,"I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Severus Snape,"Brilliant, Snape. Once again you've put your keen penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business... to attend to."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Severus Snape,Sirius Black,Give me a reason. I beg you!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Severus Snape,Severus don't be a fool.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,He can't help it. It's habit.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Sirius Black,Sirius be quiet.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,Be quiet yourself Remus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Severus Snape,"Sirius Black, Remus Lupin","Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Severus Snape,Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Severus Snape,Sirius Black,"I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Severus Snape,"Severus, please."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Severus Snape,Remus Lupin,After you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry! What did you just do?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,You attacked a teacher!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Tell me about Peter.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"The map was lying, then."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,Me?! He's mental!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,Not you! Your rat!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,Scabbers has been in my family for...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,"Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,So what?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Finger! That dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,"Sirius Black, Ron Weasley","Show me. Give it to him, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Peter Pettigrew,"Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Harry Potter",Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you! You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Peter Pettigrew,How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Peter Pettigrew,"You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Peter Pettigrew,"Remus Lupin, Sirius Black","I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? What would you have done?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Sirius Black,Peter Pettigrew,"I would have died! I would have died, rather than betray my friends!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... Your dad would have spared me! He would show me mercy!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Peter Pettigrew,"You should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Peter Pettigrew,No!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry, this man..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,"Bless you, boy! Bless you!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Peter Pettigrew,Harry Potter,Peter Pettigrew,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,"I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Okay.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You better go.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You go, I'll stay."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You okay?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I'm fine. Go.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,That looks really painful.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,So painful. They might chop it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Peter Pettigrew,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Remus Lupin,Peter Pettigrew,Get away from her!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,I know.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,What? Come and live with you?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,Remus Lupin,"Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Peter Pettigrew,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Sirius Black,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Remus Lupin",Remus! Remus! Run! Run!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Come on.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Wait! Wait!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Hermione Granger,Remus Lupin,Professor? Professor Lupin?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Ron Weasley,Remus Lupin,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"There you are, Potter!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Sirius!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Friends Become Foes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Come back here, Potter!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor's Kiss,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Dementor's Kiss,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I saw my dad.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You mean they're gonna kill him?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,It's true. Sirius is innocent.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,It's Scabbers who did it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Albus Dumbledore,Ron Weasley,Scabbers?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Ron Weasley,Albus Dumbledore,"He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Hermione Granger,Albus Dumbledore,"The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Albus Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,"I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",What the bloody hell was that all about?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Hermione's Secret,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What just happened? Where's Ron?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,7:30. Where were we at 7:30?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Come on. And we can't be seen.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,Draco Malfoy,"You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That's us.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,This is not normal.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You mean we've gone back in time?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Good punch.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Thanks. Malfoy's coming.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Vincent Crabbe,Draco Malfoy,Run.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Draco Malfoy,Hermione Granger,"Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",That felt good.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Not good, brilliant."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Onlookers to the Rescue,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Ron Weasley,Scabbers,"Scabbers, you're alive!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That's Pettigrew.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, you can't."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Are you mad?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,,Ow!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Ow! That hurt!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",Let's go.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Get away. Get off.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Buckbeak,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Buckbeak,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Your name only.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,It's such a very long name...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Buckbeak,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Where?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,Look beyond the rocks.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,What am I supposed to see?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"And all the strawberries, you see?."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Buckbeak,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,I see no strawberries.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,Over there.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Where?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,Over there.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,This way.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Let's get this over, please."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,All right.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. Not a moment ago!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,How extraordinary.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Rubeus Hagrid,,Buckbeak.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Buckbeak,Buckbeak.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Right. Well, well. We must search the grounds."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Rubeus Hagrid,Albus Dumbledore,"You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,We save Sirius.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,How?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,No idea. Look. It's Lupin.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Remus Lupin,,Immobulus!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,And Snape's coming.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,And now we wait.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Saving Lives,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,And now we wait.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,At least someone's enjoying himself.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yeah. Hermione?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Yeah?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Here we come.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That's great.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry! Run!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Let's go! What are you doing?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Saving your life!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That was so scary.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,This is horrible.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, listen to me. No one's coming."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,You're dying... both of you. Harry!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,But I don't like flying...!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,,Bombarda!
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Sirius Black,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Sirius Black,I want to go with you.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... you're meant to be here."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Sirius Black,But you're innocent.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. You have..."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Harry Potter,Sirius Black,My mother's eyes.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Truly Seen, Truly Free",Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,We have to go.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Two Places at Once,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,You've been sacked.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"No. No. I resigned, actually."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Resigned? Why?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,But Dumbledore...
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Mischief Managed,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Ron Weasley,"Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan","Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Harry. Wherever did you get it?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,"Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,What are you talking about?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Fred Weasley,Ron Weasley,Did not.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,George Weasley,Ron Weasley,Did not.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Students,,It's a Firebolt. It's the fastest broom in the world.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Harry Potter,,For me? But who sent it?
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,No one knows.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The Firebolt,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,This came with it.
