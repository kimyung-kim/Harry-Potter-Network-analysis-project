Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Shell Cottage,Luna Lovegood,Bill Weasley,It's beautiful here.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Shell Cottage,Bill Weasley,Luna Lovegood,"It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Shell Cottage,Luna Lovegood,Bill Weasley,Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Shell Cottage,Harry Potter,Bill Weasley,I need to talk to the goblin.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,How are you?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,Alive.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,You probably don't remember --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,And brought me here.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,You are a very unusual wizard.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,Why did you leave Gringotts?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Ron Weasley,Griphook,Then you're on our side.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Ron Weasley,This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,It is impossible.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,"Alone, yes. With you, no."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,How did you come by this sword?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,It's complicated.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,"There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,And she never suspected?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Ron Weasley,Griphook,Who put it there? The fake.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Ron Weasley,"It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,Perhaps.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,I have no interest in gold.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Griphook,Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,That is my price.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Griphook,Harry Potter,"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Griphook's Price,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I'm still working on that part.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Fleur Delacour,Harry Potter,He's too weak.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,Forgive me if I don't get up.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,"Anything, m'boy, anything."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"Can you identify these, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,And this?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,Was? Isn't it still?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,"The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,"There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,"He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"He has found it, sir."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Garrick Ollivander,Harry Potter,"He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Garrick Ollivander,"Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,You're sure it's hers?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I reckon you should take this then.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"If I can hold it, you can."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger","How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,That's a bit scary.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",No. I just know. When one's near.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Fleur Delacour,Hermione Granger,"This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Hermione Granger,Fleur Delacour,"It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Bill Weasley,Harry Potter,"You're leaving, aren't you."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Bill Weasley,In the morning.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Bill Weasley,Harry Potter,And Griphook?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Bill Weasley,He'll be leaving too.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Bill Weasley,Harry Potter,"Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,The sky has lost a star.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Hogwarts?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"It's not the place you left, you"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Neither am I.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Always good value. I'll miss her.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What d'you think?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You want to tell me what that is?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You mean he could see you?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Go on.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He's After You,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Bloody hell... that's a sight.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Well, how do I look?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Hideous.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I? Hold still..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger","Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,Griphook,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Goblin,Hermione Granger,Madam Lestrange.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Hermione Granger,"Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Griphook,Hey. Easy.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Ron Weasley,She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,He's right. I was being stupid.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,C'mon. Let's do it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Goblin,Hermione Granger,Identification.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,Goblin,I wish to enter my vault.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Goblin,Hermione Granger,"I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,Goblin,I don't like to be kept waiting.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Goblin,Hermione Granger,Next.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,Goblin,He's with me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,"Harry Potter,  Ron Weasley",They know!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Griphook,What do you mean?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Hermione Granger,Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,Bogrod,And why should I do that?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Hermione Granger,"It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bellatrix Lestrange,Bogrod,"No, I most certainly do not understand --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Hermione Granger,I'm afraid I must insist.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,Bogrod,Imperio.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Hermione Granger,"Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Goblin,Bogrod,"But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Goblin,I'm fully aware of that. I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Goblin,Bogrod,"Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Goblin,"Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I've run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Hermione Granger,"Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,Griphook,How long before they come after us?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Griphook,What's that? Up ahead.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",I should have known --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,Griphook,"What is that, Griphook?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,Griphook,Griphook! What is that!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,,Well done. Hey.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Griphook,You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Ron Weasley,No.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Griphook",What the devil are you all doing down here!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Harry Potter,We need him!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Griphook,"Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,Bogrod,Imperio!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Ron Weasley,Well done.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",No. It's not possible...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",It looks like it's been down here forever.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Go on.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,That's barbaric. I...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Harry Potter,We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Griphook,Bogrod ,"Ready, Bogrod?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Bogrod,Griphook,Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Harry Potter,,Lumos !
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,,Lumos !
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Hermione Granger,,Lumos !
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Blimey...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Look.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Gringotts,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley","It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Ron, your foot!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Griphook,Harry Potter,We'll be crushed! Hurry!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That's it. Up there.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,How're we going to reach it?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Give me the sword! The real one.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Keep going!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry! Behind you!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",The cup!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,In here!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Harry Potter,Griphook,"We have a deal, Griphook."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Griphook,Harry Potter,I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Harry Potter,Griphook,Griphook! Griphook!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Copping the Cup,Griphook,,Thieves! Help! Thieves!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",That's unfortunate.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I've got something. But it's mad.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,,Relashio!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,That's your idea?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Come on!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,It doesn't realize it's free!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",Bloody hell.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",We're dropping!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",I say we jump!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,When?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Voldemort,Nagini,"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",He knows.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,How is it you --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I saw him.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You let him in! Harry, you can't --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I can't always help it, Hermione!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Never mind! What did you see?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What happens when he finds out four are gone?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",What?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",What?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,You saw it?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Exit the Dragon,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",They were ready for us.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Death Eater,Harry Potter,"We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Death Eater,Harry Potter,Perhaps you need some convincing.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What's he mean by that?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"No, you'll give us away."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Final Hiding Place,Harry Potter,,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"In here, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I know.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry! I can see you! In here!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,You're Aberforth.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Where've you left him?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,He's dead.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Aberforth Dumbledore,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,The Order is finished. You-Know- Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Did he now? Nice job? Easy?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,Why should he...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Keep secrets? You tell me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Did you now? And why is that?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,I had no reason not to ??
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,You're drunk.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Ariana Dumbledore,You know what to do...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aberforth Dumbledore,Where've you sent her?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,You'll see soon enough.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Aberforth Dumbledore,"That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,She'll always be beautiful.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Aberforth Dumbledore,"She died very young, didn't she."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Aberforth Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Aberforth Dumbledore,Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,Aberforth Dumbledore,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, Ron Weasley",She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Aberforth Dumbledore,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Who's that with her? Bloody hell...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom ,"Neville, you look..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Aberforth Dumbledore,"Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Ron Weasley,Well? Ready?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ron Weasley,Neville Longbottom ,I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Ron Weasley,That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Hermione Granger,Neville Longbottom ,"How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom ,The Carrows?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Hermione Granger,Neville Longbottom ,They did that to you? But why?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Hermione Granger,Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,All,"Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Seamus Finnigan,Neville Longbottom ,Blimey.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Seamus Finnigan,Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Nigel Wolpert,,"River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,,"Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,All,"Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,What is it?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom ,We don't know.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Dean Thomas,Harry Potter,Where is it?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,Dean Thomas,I realize it's not much to go on.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,That's nothing to go on.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,All ,"I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Luna Lovegood,All,The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Cho Chang,Luna Lovegood,"Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ron Weasley,Cho Chang,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Cho Chang,Ron Weasley,"It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,"Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ron Weasley,Seamus Finnigan,"Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Seamus Finnigan,Ron Weasley,"Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ron Weasley,Seamus Finnigan,"Shut up, Seamus."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Neville Longbottom,Ginny Weasley,"What is it, Ginny?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Ginny Weasley,All,Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Hogwarts Reunion,Alecto Carrow,,"Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,All,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,All,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,All,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Severus Snape,All,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,How dare you stand where he stood.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,I'm a Gryffindor.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Voldemort,All,I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Voldemort,All,I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Voldemort,All,Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Pansy parkinson,All,But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Argus Filch,All,Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Argus Filch,,"Oh. Sorry, mum."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Give Me Harry Potter,Argus Filch,,Right away.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Harry Potter,Minerva Mcgonagall,Time. As much as you can give me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Harry Potter,Minerva Mcgonagall,"Is that possible, Professor?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Harry Potter,Minerva Mcgonagall,I think you're right.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Harry Potter,Minerva Mcgonagall,"You, too, Professor."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Neville Longbottom,Filius Flitwick,"Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Neville Longbottom,Filius Flitwick,To blow it up. Boom.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Neville Longbottom,Seamus Finnigan,Wicked.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Seamus Finnigan,Neville Longbottom ,I can bring 'er down.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Filius Flitwick,Pomona Sprout,"You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Pomona Sprout,Filius Flitwick,That doesn't mean we can't hold him up.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Professors,,Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Unless we can destroy it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,So we were thinking --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Duty To Our School,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Where are you going?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"We'll talk later, Luna."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Harry --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Later.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,You Need Only Ask,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"He's very impressive, isn't he?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Voldemort,All,They never learn. Such a pity.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Voldemort,All,Begin.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Pius Thicknesse,Voldemort,"But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Fred Weasley,,Nice night for it!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Seamus Finnigan,Neville Longbottom ,That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Neville Longbottom,Seamus Finnigan,"You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Neville Longbottom,,Blimey.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Neville Longbottom,,Not good.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"If you're to find her, you'll find her down there."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Kingsley Shacklebolt,Dean Thomas,Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Dean Thomas,Kingsley Shacklebolt,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Kingsley Shacklebolt,Dean Thomas,Dean!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Remus Lupin,Kingsley Shacklebolt,"It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Kingsley Shacklebolt,Remus Lupin,Who said that?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Remus Lupin,Kingsley Shacklebolt,Me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Remus Lupin,Kingsley Shacklebolt,Speaking of quality.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Remus Lupin,Nymphadora Tonks,You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Nymphadora Tonks,Remus Lupin,He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,It's you...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Neville Longbottom,,Ha! dal
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Neville Longbottom,,Yeah! You and whose army!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Seamus Finnigan,Neville Longbottom ,Woah! Easy up there!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Neville Longbottom,Seamus Finnigan,Sorry.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,No. Of course not.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,I've never got this far before.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I'm scared.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Blow For Blow,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Not this.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,I do not answer to that name.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,Are you a friend of Luna's?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,You seek my mother's diadem.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,Yes! That's right --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,"Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,Wait! Please!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,I want to destroy it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,"That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,"But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,"I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory ??"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,"Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,Tom Riddle --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,But he lied.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,He's lied to many people --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,Strange... you remind me of him a bit...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,It's here. In the castle. In the
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Helena Ravenclaw,Harry Potter,"If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask..."

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Finding the Diadem,Harry Potter,Helena Ravenclaw,Thank you... -.. then running.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,You do it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Yes, you can."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Neville Longbottom,Ginny Weasley,Not good.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ginny Weasley,Neville Longbottom ,Ready!?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Neville Longbottom,Ginny Weasley,Are you bloody joking?!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Seamus Finnigan,,He's good...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Seamus Finnigan,,He's good...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ginny Weasley,,What?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Neville Longbottom,,That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ginny Weasley,,Mad. The both of you.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Neville Longbottom,,Not good.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Argus Filch,Pansy Parkinson,Night-tee night.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Pansy parkinson,Argus Filch,"You let us out of here, you filthy squib!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,"Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom",Ginny! Neville! You alright?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom ,Luna -- ?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ginny Weasley,,I know.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,There he is.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,That's right. I did.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Let's go.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Draco Malfoy,,Take my hand.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,I could ask you the same.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,I virtually lived here last year. Remember?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,I remember.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,What's wrong with the one you have?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,Easy.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,Why didn't you tell her?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,Give me my wand.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,No. I don't think so...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Draco Malfoy,"Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Gregory Goyle,Draco Malfoy,"C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Gregory Goyle,Harry Potter,Avada Kedavra!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Gregory Goyle,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Did you see where it went? The diadem!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger",Split up!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Do we climb!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"No, it''ll just follow us!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,,Here! Take one!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Serves him right.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,C'mon! This way!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Voldemort,Nagini,Nagini. Come.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,,You're bloody well welcome!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,He does.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Where will he take her?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Someplace safe.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,No. He'll keep her close.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Look inside him, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Fiendfyre,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Lucius Malfoy,Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Lucius Malfoy,Voldemort,"Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Lucius Malfoy,"I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Lucius Malfoy,Voldemort,"Of c-course, my Lord."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Lucius Malfoy,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",I know where he is.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Sybill Trelawney,Seamus Finnigan,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Luna Lovegood,Neville Longbottom ,Thanks.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Neville Longbottom,Luna Lovegood,Don't mention it.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,Why doesn't it work for me?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Severus Snape,Voldemort,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Severus Snape,Voldemort,"There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,Does it?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Severus Snape,Voldemort,My Lord?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,"You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,"Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Severus Snape,Voldemort,"With you, of course, my Lord."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,"The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Severus Snape,Voldemort,My Lord --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,But only I can live forever...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Severus Snape,Kill.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,He Will Come To Me,Voldemort,Nagini,Nagini! Come!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Take them...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Take them!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Please.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,They are the same...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,You have your mother's eyes...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,He's gone. The snake too.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Voldemort,All,You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical bliood
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Voldemort,All,"I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Ron Weasley,Voldemort,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Where is everyone?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,,Lily... Then...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Petunia Dursley,Lily Potter,Lily! Come out of there! Now!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Petunia Dursley,Lily Potter,We're going home.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Lily Potter,She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Lily Potter,Severus Snape,That's mean.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Lily Potter,It's true. You know so yourself.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,No! Don't kill me!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,That wasn't my intention.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Is this about the Prophecy?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,How much did you relay?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,I have asked.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Anything.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,You said you would keep her safe!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,The boy survives.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,He has her eyes.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,No one can know. Your word.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,You see what you want to see.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Perhaps. oOh. Severus.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,I was... foolish... greedy...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,For the time being?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,It will spread.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,How long?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Maybe a year.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,It is not expected that he will succeed.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,You must agree.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,You ask too much.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Tell him what?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Lily. After all this time?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Always... We GO TO BLACK...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Your Mother's Eyes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Where've you been?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I'm going there now.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Are you mad! No!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,It's... meant to be.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"What is it, Harry? What is it you"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I think I've known for awhile.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I'll go with you. I/'ll --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom ,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Oliver Wood,,I'll take him from here.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Ginny Weasley,,It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Student,,I kept calling. No one came.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Confront Your Fate,Ginny Weasley,,Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Lily Potter,Harry Potter,"You've been so brave, sweetheart."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,"Lily Potter, James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin",Why are you here? All of you?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Lily Potter,Harry Potter,"We never left, dear."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Does it hurt? Dying?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Quicker than falling asleep.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,And he will want it to be quick.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,James Potter,Harry Potter,"You're nearly there, son."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,James Potter,You'll stay with me?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,James Potter,Harry Potter,Until the end.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,Sirius Black,He won't be able to see you?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"No. We're here, you see."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Harry Potter,Lily Potter,Stay close to me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,I Open At the Close,Lily Potter,Harry Potter,Always...
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Boy Who Lived,Corban Yaxley,Voldemort,"No sign of him, my Lord."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Boy Who Lived,Voldemort,All,"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Boy Who Lived,Harry Potter,Voldemort,You weren't.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Boy Who Lived,Corban Yaxley,,Quiet!
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,The Boy Who Lived,Voldemort,Harry Potter,Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,You cannot help.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Oh, yes."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Then... I'm dead too?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Not?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Not.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Professor, is that -- ?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Exactly where are we, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sir --
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I've got to go back, haven't I?"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,That is up to you.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I've got a choice?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And where would it take me?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,On.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,True.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And the snake lives.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And I've nothing to kill it with.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,King's Cross,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
