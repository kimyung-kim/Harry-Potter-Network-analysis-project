Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,Narcissa!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Bellatrix Lestrange,The Dark Lord trusts him.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,The Dark Lord is mistaken.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,Or so I believe.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Well, who can one trust these days?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,He lives in this Muggle dunghill?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Narcissa Malfoy,"Run along, Wormtail."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Severus Snape,"I've nowhere else to turn, Severus."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,You must be joking.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Severus Snape,I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,"Narcissa Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange","If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,You? The Dark Lord told you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Narcissa Malfoy,"Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Narcissa Malfoy,Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Narcissa Malfoy,Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Severus Snape,"I... I don't doubt you, Severus."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa Malfoy,"You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Severus Snape,He's just a boy!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Narcissa Malfoy,I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Severus Snape,"Do you mean it, Severus?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Narcissa Malfoy,I can try.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Narcissa Malfoy,Severus Snape,"Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,Swear to it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Bellatrix Lestrange,Take out your wand.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,"Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Bellatrix Lestrange,I will.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,"And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Bellatrix Lestrange,I will.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,"And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Snape's Visitors,Severus Snape,Bellatrix Lestrange,I will.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Waitress,Harry Potter,Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Harry Potter,Waitress,Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Waitress,Harry Potter,"Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Harry Potter,Waitress,Really.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Waitress,Harry Potter,Thought I'd gone round the twist.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Harry Potter,Waitress,Hey.  I was wondering...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Who's Harry Potter?,Waitress,Harry Potter,Eleven.  That's when I get off.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I just Apparated, didn't I?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Can't imagine why...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Wand out, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,,Lumos...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,Horace!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Merlin's Beard!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,"I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,Dragon's blood.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,"Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,"So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,Take matters into their own hands?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,"Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,That was fun.  May I use the loo?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"My mother's eyes, yeah."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Of course.  But you're not leaving?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,Indeed they are.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, exactly what was that all --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Both are waiting for you.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sir?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Molly Weasley,Hedwig...?  Mum!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Molly Weasley,Exactly.  How'd you guess?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Molly Weasley,"I'm joking, Mum."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Ginny Weasley,You're worse than Fred and George.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Molly Weasley,Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Ginny Weasley,Harry who?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Molly Weasley,"Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Ginny Weasley,"I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Molly Weasley,Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Ginny Weasley,I seriously doubt that.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,All,Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Ron Weasley,"Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Ginny Weasley,"'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,All,Was that an owl I heard?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Ginny Weasley,Really?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Really.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,All,Didn't know. Dumbledore.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Molly Weasley,Ron Weasley,"That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You've a bit of...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,When'd you get here?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Oh come on...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,,Step up!  Step up!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,,Step up!  Step up!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Harry Potter,We've got Fainting Fancy...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Nosebleed Nougats...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Harry Potter,And just in time for school...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Puking Pastilles!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Into the cauldron, handsome."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Into the cauldron, handsome."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"What'd you think, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",Amazing.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Harry Potter,Bloody urchins.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,A real money spinner that.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Yes, they do really work."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",Meaning?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Ginny Weasley,Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",None of your business.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",These are adorable.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Ron Weasley,Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",How much for this?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Fred Weasley,Ron Weasley,Five Galleons.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,George Weasley,Ron Weasley,Five Galleons.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",How much for me?

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"George Weasley, Fred Weasley",C'mon. Let's go.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Lavender Brown,Ron Weasley,"Hi, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Lavender Brown,Hi.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Reckon he's right...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Oh no.  Look.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",What're they playing at?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Dunno.  Let's get closer.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Hey.  Where's Hermione?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, where is she?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I don't know.  I'm turned around.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Bloody hell.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Sorry.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",What just happened?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",I don't know.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Luna Lovegood,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Luna Lovegood,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Luna Lovegood,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ginny Weasley,Luna Lovegood,Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Luna Lovegood,All,They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",It's happened.  He's one of them.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,One of what?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,What Could Be Safer?,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",I need some air.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Blaise Zabini,What just happened?  Blaise?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Blaise Zabini,Draco Malfoy,Don't know.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Pansy Parkinson,"Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini","Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Pansy Parkinson,Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Pansy Parkinson,Draco Malfoy,What's that supposed to mean?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Blaise Zabini,Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Blaise Zabini,"Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Where's Harry?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Probably on the platform.  C'mon.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,"Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson",You two go on.  I want to check something.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,"Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson","Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,"Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson","Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,"Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson",Enjoy the ride back to London.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Hello, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Luna.  How'd you...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"I am your friend, Luna."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,That's nice.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Filius Flitwick,"Harry Potter, Luna Lovegood",About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Filius Flitwick,"Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years."

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Filius Flitwick,Luna Lovegood,Aurors. For security.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Argus Filch,"It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Argus Filch,Draco Malfoy,And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,It was his father's.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,Is my father's.  He's not dead.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Severus Snape,Argus Filch,"It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Nice face, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,What the hell.  Give it a go.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Episkey.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Well?  How do I look?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Exceptionally ordinary.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,That's For My Father,Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ginny Weasley,Ron Weasley,He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ron Weasley,Ginny Weasley,Looks like his own this time.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Later.  What've I missed?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Thanks...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,What's happened to his hand?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Albus Dumbledore,All,"The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Albus Dumbledore,All,"Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ron Weasley,,That was cheerful.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,,"History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Potter!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,This can't be good.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Enjoying ourself, are we?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Dark Forces,Ron Weasley,Minerva McGonagall,But I don't want to take Potions!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Ron Weasley,Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Ron Weasley,Horace Slughorn,"Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Ron Weasley,"Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Hermione Granger,"Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,"Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,"It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Hermione Granger,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,All,"Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Katie Bell,Horace Slughorn,"Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Katie Bell,Ah yes...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,All,"What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,Liquid luck.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Hermione Granger,"Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Katie Bell,Horace Slughorn,But then why don't people drink it all the time?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Katie Bell,"Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Blaise Zabini,Horace Slughorn,"Have you ever taken it, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Blaise Zabini,Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,All,"So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,All,"You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,How did you do that?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Crush it.  Don't cut it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,No.  Really --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Sh!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Half Blood Prince,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,So.  How are you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Fine, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I think he overestimates my abilities, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Do you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Definitely.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sir?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Forgive me, Harry, I..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Mrs. Cole,Albus Dumbledore,"I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Mrs. Cole,I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Mrs. Cole,Albus Dumbledore,I see...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Mrs. Cole,Albus Dumbledore,I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Mrs. Cole,Perhaps you could give me an example.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Mrs. Cole,Albus Dumbledore,"You've got a visitor, Tom."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Mrs. Cole,"How do you do, Tom."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Mrs. Cole,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Don't.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,As you wish.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"You're the doctor, aren't you?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,No.  I am a Professor.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,"I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Perhaps they're right.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,I'm not mad.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,It's a school.  A school of... magic.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Who are you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"I'm like you, Tom.  Different."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Prove it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Take it out.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"Why did you want these things, Tom?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,I can speak to snakes too.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Tom Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,It is unusual.  But not unheard of.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Did you know, sir?  Then?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I did.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Do you want me to let him?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Secret Riddle,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Shut It!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Cormac McLaggen,Ron Weasley,"No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,Cormac McLaggen,Hard feelings?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Cormac McLaggen,Ron Weasley,I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,Cormac McLaggen,"Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Cormac McLaggen,Harry Potter,"I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Cormac McLaggen,"All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Cormac McLaggen,Ginny Weasley,Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ginny Weasley,Cormac McLaggen,"Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,All,Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"C'mon, Ron..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Lavender Brown,All,Isn't he brilliant?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,He's vile.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Ever heard of this spell?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,What?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,No.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Why not?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,The binding is fragile?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ginny Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",The who?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",The who?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ginny Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley","I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter","Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Well, I was curious.  So I went to"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",The library.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Ron Weasley,"Hermione Granger, Harry Potter",The library.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",And?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hermione's Helping Hand,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Good.  That settles it then.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Hey, you three!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"What've you got there, Hagrid?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,Filius Flitwick,Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Filius Flitwick,Horace Slughorn,"Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Who's up for a Butterbeer?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,No.  Over here.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"No, no.  Sit next to me."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,O-kay.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Skinny kid,Hermione Granger,What'll we have?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Skinny kid,"Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Aw, bloody hell..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,And snogging.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,I'd like to leave.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Leave?  You can't be serious.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,That happens to be my sister.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Harry, m'boy!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"So what brings you here, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I'd consider it an honor, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"You'd be welcome too, Granger."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,"Be delighted, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Horace Slughorn,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What're you playing at?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Get to know him?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Um... You've got a little...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Leanne,Hermione Granger,Katie.  You don't know what it could be!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Leanne,What's up?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Leanne,Hermione Granger,I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I'll get someone --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",There's no time!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Get back!  All o' yeh!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Now, now.  Now, now..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,Leanne,"You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Leanne,Minerva McGonagall,It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,Leanne,Did she say to whom?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,Leanne,"All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Minerva McGonagall,"Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,Severus Snape,Severus. Is this it?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Severus Snape,Minerva McGonagall,What do you think?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Severus Snape,Minerva McGonagall,I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Yes.  She was cursed.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,It was Malfoy.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"That's a very serious accusation, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Indeed.  Your evidence?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,I... just... know.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Minerva McGonagall,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What does she see in him?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Dean?  He's brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I suppose.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,So what is it?  He sees in her?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Attractive?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You know.  She's... got nice skin.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I think I'll be going to sleep now.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Cursed Necklace,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Right.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,All,To Hogwarts' best and brightest!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Cormac McLaggen,Neville Longbottom,"Here, here!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Neville Longbottom,Cormac McLaggen,Which one do I use for the soup?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Cormac McLaggen,"So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Cormac McLaggen,Horace Slughorn,"Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Marcus Belby,"Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Marcus Belby,Horace Slughorn,Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Hermione Granger,"And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Hermione Granger,Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,"No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Ginny Weasley,"Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Ginny Weasley,Horace Slughorn,"Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Ginny Weasley,No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Nothing.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,All,"Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Oh.  Potter.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,I think I'll be going.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"The shelf, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I don't really know how to answer that, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,What was he like?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Slug Club,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Neville Longbottom,Ron Weasley,"Good luck, eh, Ron?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Seamus Finnigan,Ron Weasley,"Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,So.  How was it?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,How was what?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Your dinner party.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Actually, I was going to ask you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Really?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Lavender Brown,Ron Weasley,"Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Lavender Brown,I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Have it your way.  Juice?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Sure...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Luna Lovegood,Ron Weasley,"Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Luna Lovegood,Ron Weasley,Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Don't drink that, Ron!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,You could be expelled for that.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Dunno what you're talking about.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,What's gotten into him?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Dean Thomas,Ginny Weasley,Ginny!  Let's go!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Students,All,Weasley!  Weasley!  Weasley!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You shouldn't have done it, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Felix Felicis,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Charms spell.  Just practicing.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Ah.  Well... they're really good.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Lavender Brown,Ron Weasley,Oops.  I think this room's taken.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,What's with the birds?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Oppugno!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,It feels like this.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Have you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Yes.  Why?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Why didn't I think of that?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,So who are you taking?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Really...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,But I am the Chosen One.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,How It Feels,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Horace Slughorn,All,"Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Drink?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,Neville...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Eldred Worple,Luna Lovegood,"Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What're you doing?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,And what's happened to you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Cormac!  That's who you invited!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Waiter,Hermione Granger,Dragon tartar?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Hermione Granger,Waiter,No thank you.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Waiter,Hermione Granger,Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Hermione Granger,Waiter,"On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I think she went to powder her nose.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Cormac McLaggen,Harry Potter,"Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Cormac McLaggen,Dragon balls.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,All,What's going on back here?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Cormac McLaggen,"You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Not so quick, Potter."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Besides, I only wish to convey a message."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,A message...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Traveling?  Where?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Argus Filch,Horace Slughorn,"Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,"Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,I'll escort him out.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,Certainly... Professor.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,"You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Free Agents,Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Positive.  Why?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Lovely.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I'll take your word for it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Unbreakable Vow,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You die.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Molly Weasley,All,"Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,"Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I know it sounds mad --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,That's not what it sounded like.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Nymphadora Tonks,Remus Lupin,"Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,Nymphadora Tonks,"It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,You're blinded by hatred.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,I'm not --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Open up, you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Don't trust me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,It's good.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Remus Lupin,You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,"Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Did you get my owl?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Go on.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,A Vanishing Cabinet?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,Nothing.  It's still there.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Nymphadora Tonks,Molly Weasley,"It was delicious, Molly.  Really."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Molly Weasley,Nymphadora Tonks,You're sure you won't stay?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Nymphadora Tonks,Molly Weasley,"No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Molly Weasley,Remus Lupin,Remus...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Everyone gone to bed?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Soon.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Nymphadora Tonks,,Sweetheart...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Remus Lupin,,There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,,Oh my god...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, no!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Nymphadora Tonks,Remus Lupin,Remus!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Arthur Weasley,Ginny Weasley,"Ginny, stay with your mother!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"No, Harry!  It's a trap!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Fenrir Greyback,Harry Potter,Don't you smell clean.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You have to realize who you are, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You tell me.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Who could tell the difference?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Lavender Brown,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",That's my Won-Won.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Death Eaters Attack,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Excuse me, I have to go vomit."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,Intuition.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,I know a secret shortcut or two.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,Go on.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I don't understand -- what happened?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I suspect he is ashamed of it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Why?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Why indeed.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I don't know him that well, sir --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sluggish Memory,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Sir --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Nice.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",The Map is never wrong.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Or twenty.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Excuse me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Well... Brilliant.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Do you think she knows I exist?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Who're you talking about?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Okay.  Very funny.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What the hell was that for?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,No.  Can you introduce me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,How do I look?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Devastatingly handsome.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Damn it all!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Horace Slughorn,Where's Romilda?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",What's the matter with Wenby?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Horace Slughorn,"Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Ron Weasley,Hm.  Perhaps you're right.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,I'll ask you not to use that name.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Horace Slughorn,What's this?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Ron Weasley,A tonic for the nerves.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Horace Slughorn,What happened to me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Love potion.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,And a bloody strong one at that.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Horace Slughorn,I feel really... bad.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","There we are, Potter.  To life!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, Horace Slughorn","Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,I d-don't understand --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Professor!  Do something!!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,He's choking!!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Minerva McGonagall,Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Minerva McGonagall,Horace Slughorn,I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,Why indeed.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,"This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,To whom might I ask?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Albus Dumbledore,"You, Headmaster."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Lavender Brown,Hermione Granger,Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Lavender Brown,I might ask you the same.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Lavender Brown,Hermione Granger,I happen to be his girlfriend.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Lavender Brown,I happen to be his... friend.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Lavender Brown,Lavender Brown,Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Lavender Brown,"He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Lavender Brown,Hermione Granger,"Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ron Weasley,,Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Albus Dumbledore,Ginny Weasley,"Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Ginny Weasley,Albus Dumbledore,"'Bout time, don't you think?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Horace Slughorn,Hermione Granger,I've always cherished my students. They're my life...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Perilous Potions,Hermione Granger,Horace Slughorn,Oh shut up.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Huh?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Right.  Boggled...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Hermione Granger,"Ron Weasley, Harry Potter",That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Harry Potter,Katie Bell,"How are you, Katie?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Katie Bell,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter","Give me a moment, girls."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Katie Bell,Harry Potter,"I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Draco Malfoy,,Cruci--
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Harry Potter,,Sectumsempra!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Draco Malfoy,Ginny Weasley,Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Sectumsempra,Ginny Weasley,Draco Malfoy,You have to get rid of it.  Today.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Take my hand.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,The Room of Requirement...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Who showed you this?  First.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,What was that?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"See, you never know what you'll find up here."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Hiding the Book,Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"That can stay hidden up here too, if you like."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You know.  Hide the book.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Oh.  Yeah.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Say that again.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Well?  How do you feel?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Excellent.  Really excellent.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley",Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Merlin's beard, Harry!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Sir?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Well, then by all means come along, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,"Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"That would be counterproductive, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,And what makes you say that?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,No idea.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Merlin's beard...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Is that an actual Acromantula?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"A dead one, I think, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,'Arry.  'Orace.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,"Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"I'm sorry, I... didn't realize."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,"Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Not to mention the pincers.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Through the front doors.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,"Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Oh yeah.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Farewell...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,Aragog.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Liquid Luck,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"And Odo the hero, they bore him back home..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,"To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,"I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,Tha's odd.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Rubeus Hagrid,Horace Slughorn,No idea... no idea at all...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,"Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Rubeus Hagrid,I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Please don't say his --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Harry Potter,Horace Slughorn,"Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,After Aragog's Burial,Horace Slughorn,Harry Potter,Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Horace Slughorn,How is he?  Horace?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,Intuition.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,I know a secret shortcut or two.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,Go on.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,Excuse me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,Protected?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"How does one split his soul, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,Murder.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Horace Slughorn,Tom Riddle,"This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Tom Riddle,Horace Slughorn,"Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sir --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Tom Riddle's diary --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And the ring...?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,One destroys Voldemort.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"True.  But magic, especially Dark magic..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,... leaves traces.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Once again, I shall ask too much of you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry.  It's time.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,If one wants it to be.  Why?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,He was going to the Room of Requirement.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,What if there are?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I don't know...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Good luck, mate."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"Harry.  You need a shave, my friend."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,"At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You look the same to me, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Should I tell you to run, you will run."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,You will do so.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Your word, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,My word.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Take my arm.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Being me has its privileges.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It's there, isn't it?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sir!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You should've let me, sir."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Careful.  The water.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,,Accio Horcrux!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Perhaps not.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"If you would, Harry..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Remember... the water.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Oh yes.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,It has to be drunk.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Why can't I drink it, sir?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Professor?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Professor?  Can you hear me?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Don't... don't make me...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Nooooooo!!!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,My fault.  It's all my fault...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,What?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Your word, Harry!  Your word!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,No...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Kill me!  It's the only way!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I promise.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Water. Water...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Aguamenti.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"You did it, sir.  Look --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Water!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I'm trying, sir.  I'm --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Go...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,We have to... go.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Horcruxes,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,To your Houses.  No dawdling.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,All right.  Okay.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, are you... praying?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Do as I say, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Trust me.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,Who else is here?  I heard you talking.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"You are not an assassin, Draco."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,He trusts me!  I was chosen!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,Then I shall make it easy for you.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,Expelliarumus!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,That cabinet has been broken for years.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,I've been mending it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Draco Malfoy,Albus Dumbledore,I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Draco Malfoy,"Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Bellatrix Lestrange,Albus Dumbledore,"Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Bellatrix Lestrange,Draco Malfoy,"Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Bellatrix Lestrange,Albus Dumbledore,"Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Fenrir Greyback,Draco Malfoy,Do it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Bellatrix Lestrange,Draco Malfoy,He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,"No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,No.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Severus...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Bellatrix Lestrange,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Albus Dumbledore,Severus Snape,Severus... please.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Severus Snape,Albus Dumbledore,I gave my word.  I made a vow...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,The Astronomy Tower,Severus Snape,,Avada Kedavra!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,Bellatrix Lestrange,You can no longer stay here.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Bellatrix Lestrange,Severus Snape,Boo.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Bellatrix Lestrange,Draco Malfoy,Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,,Go on!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,,Go on!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,,Cruciatus!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,,Incacerata!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,,Impedimenta!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"Fight!  Fight back, you coward!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,,Sectumsempra!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid... HAGRID!
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid!  You alright?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid, Dumbledore --"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Flight of the Prince,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Potter.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,You should know... Professor Dumbledore...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,You meant a great deal to him.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Dumbledore.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Go on.  Open it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'"
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I'm not coming back, Hermione."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,We reckoned -- Ron and me.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Like that's going to happen.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Besides, he's barking."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Funny, he says the same about you."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You're brilliant.  You both are.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,R.a.B.,Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Do you think we'll ever... come back?
